          <p>The Mental Game reflects a moment of tension that everyone has experienced before. As a child, maybe it&rsquo;s jumping down more steps than you&rsquo;ve ever tried. As a teenager, maybe it&rsquo;s clicking &ldquo;submit&rdquo; on an application that will decide your future. As an adult, maybe it&rsquo;s stepping into a class far out of your comfort zone. In a single moment, instinctual hesitation kicks in. Time seems to slow down and you feel separated from the world. Then it&rsquo;s over before you know it.</p>
<p>I use a moving still in conjunction with a still-looking GIF to replicate how I experience this feeling. By using both mediums, I try to create a sense of disorientation by breaking expectations. The calm stare is captured by a moving gif and the rapid fall is captured by a still. Two expected pieces of information - what&rsquo;s in front of her and what she&rsquo;s jumping down to -  are missing, faded into the rest of the screen. Examining the alignment, one interpretation could be self-observation from a third person perspective, possibly using her imagination. The environment is left empty to give a sense of disconnection from the rest of the world. The images are embedded into the webpage, making use of the entire screen to increase immersion.</p>
<p>The use of a comic format is reminiscent of the work discussed by Lugon and Guido. It plays with the idea that sequences, in both film and comics, are &ldquo;building blocks with neatly delimited contours.&rdquo; Instead, the &ldquo;pregnant moment&rdquo; that my sequence captures literally lacks delimitations, both spatially and temporally. This makes the &ldquo;mapping of time back upon space&rdquo; as described by Frampton more tenuous, giving more room for the viewer&rsquo;s own constructions to fill the gaps.</p>
