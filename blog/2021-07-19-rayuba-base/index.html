      <div class="serif-font fade-in later"><p>The world was still, and then there were screams. A huge creature emerged from the rubble. Joints aching for the first time in many turns, Deeushan patted himself down and walked through the colored scraps, shattered bottles, and dripping pipes. Dust, smoke, mist, and magic left a haze and the smell of ammonia in the air. He filled his lungs with satisfaction. He yanked at the knotted apron around his neck, the top half falling to his knees. Grabbed a large bag. This was it. The entirety of his life stretched out before him, summoning him out of bondage to meet his destiny. No more masters.</p>
<ul>
<li>Belongs to a dwindling race of mining servants - boring machines have become widespread in the Empire.</li>
<li>Sold into the workshop of an ancient guru practicing alchemy and blacksmithing, making mystical equipment for heroes and villains.</li>
<li>Believes in true anarchy - he remembers each and every injustice done to him, his clan, and his race in their long lives by &ldquo;civilized and progressive&rdquo; governance.</li>
<li>Quiet, calm, and methodical.</li>
<li>Naturally attuned senses - especially to smell and vibrations.</li>
<li>Naturally robust, adapted to the rigors of moving earth at great depths.</li>
<li>Unnaturally intelligent - has learned everything from his master and understands how materials and magic interact. Experimented on and augmented himself.</li>
<li>Very well equipped with equipment and potions.</li>
