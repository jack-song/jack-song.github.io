      <p>I thought I had found a flaw in the great google machine - instead I learned that <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeWharton/status/806344184999399424">&ldquo;libraries are innocent until proven guilty&rdquo;</a>.
</p>

<p>I am currently working on an app for Kenyan users, with validation for local phone numbers. We use google&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber">libphonenumber</a> library. While testing, I realized that my Kenyan number was considered invalid.</p>

<p>I check the source code and searched for &ldquo;kenya&rdquo;: &ldquo;Prefix 25476 added for Airtel Kenya based on open-source bug report [&hellip;] other prefixes from Wikipedia.&rdquo; I take a look and Wikipedia does not contain a prefix for my number. Everything made sense - my number was recently issued. There&rsquo;s no way google has the resources to keep up with all the technical changes in the world - and certainly not in Kenya where documentation is poor and growth is fast.</p>

<p>I regretfully hammer out a horrific switch case method to validate phone numbers instead of using the library - we did not have time to wait for a fix. But as I go to file a bug report, I read the guidelines: &ldquo;Is the issue reproducible using the demo? [&hellip;] Your issue may be resolved by upgrading to the latest version of the library.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oh.</p>

<p>I try my Kenyan number in the online demo. It&rsquo;s valid. Searching the issues gives <a href="https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/issues/804">this</a>. I rollback and update the library.</p>

<p>So even if you&rsquo;re in a volatile domain - give the library the benefit of the doubt and first RTFM. I guess I could at least submit a change to Wikipedia.</p>

<p>An argument can also be made that in a domain <em>this</em> volatile, it could be wise to use a less strict form of validation in the first place, depending the importance of the features vs. handling illegal values.</p>

<p>At least they&rsquo;re responsive!</p>
