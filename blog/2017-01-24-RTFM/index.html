      <h2>
          RTFM
      </h2>

      <p>I thought this would be a story about finding a flaw in the great google machine - instead it&rsquo;s about being prudent when working with dependencies.
</p>

<p>I am currently working on an app for Kenyan users. With SMS functionality, we have validation for local phone numbers. While we were testing, I realized that my number is considered invalid by google&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber">libphonenumber</a> library. It has a 254798 prefix presumably newly introduced as I had picked up my SIM at the airport days earlier.</p>

<p>I check the library and searched for &ldquo;kenya&rdquo;. After a quick scan, a comment stands out: &ldquo;Prefix 25476 added for Airtel Kenya based on open-source bug report.&rdquo; Followed by &ldquo;other prefixes from Wikipedia.&rdquo; I take a look and Wikipedia does not contain a prefix for my number. Everything made sense. There&rsquo;s no way google has the resources to keep up with all the technical changes in the world - and certainly not the developing areas where documentation is poor and good practice is as well respected as traffic regulations.</p>

<p>Excitedly, I thought I would get to file a bug report against a google repository. Nervously, I realized we&rsquo;d have to roll our own phone number validation to release on schedule. So I hammer out a horrific switch case method and throw it in.
But as I go to file the report, I read the issue guidelines, which includes this step: &ldquo;Is the issue reproducible using the demo?,&rdquo; and this step: &ldquo;Your issue may be resolved by upgrading to the latest version of the library.&rdquo; Mmmmmm. I try my number in the online demo. It works. I go back to the code file. Appended at the very end of file: &ldquo;25479|Safaricom.&rdquo; Sure enough, searching the issues gives <a href="https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/issues/804">this</a>.</p>

<p>I rollback and just update the library. Maybe I should submit a change to Wikipedia.
So even if you&rsquo;re using a library for a volatile domain - give them the benefit of the doubt and first RTFM.
An argument can also be made that in a domain <em>this</em> volatile, it could be wise to use a less strict form of validation in the first place, depending on the business value of the feature always working vs. the consequences of allowing an illegal value.</p>

<p>At least they&rsquo;re responsive!</p>
