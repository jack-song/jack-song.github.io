<h3 id="stereography">Stereography</h3>

<p>A technique to generate a sense of depth in a visualization by presenting a different image to each eye. Mimics the way humans naturally perceive depth in every day life. Various techniques have been used, ranging from mechanical devices working with film photographs to polarized light in a 3D movie. Can be a highly effective technique, but usually requires a fairly complex mechanism. This may affect the experience of the viewer.</p>

<p>Examples include a stereograph of the moon:

<p>and a stereograph generated via smartphone:

<h3 id="autostereogram">Autostereogram</h3>

<p>A stereogram image pair that can be viewed without a specialized device. Instead, viewing techniques used by the viewer are leverged to give the desired effect. This requires a change in how the viewer visually focuses on the image to create a parallax effect. Without using these techniques, autostereograms often do not give many indications on the 3D content &mdash; producing a sense of discovery for the viewer. Unfortunately, some viewers may be incapable of applying these techniques effectively, especially depending on how the image has been generated.</p>

<p>Examples include autostereograms created by Scott Pakin:

<h3 id="wigglegram">Wigglegram</h3>

<p>A stereogram image pair that can be viewed without a specialized device. Instead, motion is simulated by alternating between images to create a parallax effect. This is usually displayed as an animated GIF or video. Adjusting the dynamics of motion, such as the speed at which images are swapped, can change how the 3D effect is perceived. Details in the image can be difficult to focus on for the viewer due to the constant motion.</p>

<p>Examples include a gif generated from images taken in 1927:

<h3 id="cinemagraph">Cinemagraph</h3>

<p>A video that features only a small, subtle, repeated movement, partially imitating a still image. Generally shown in the .GIF file format, with a certain visual aesthetic. Cinemagraphs have been popularized very recently, in 2011, by the work of Kevin Burg and Jamie Beck [1].</p>

<p>Examples include fashion cinemagraphs by Kevin Burg and Jamie Beck:
