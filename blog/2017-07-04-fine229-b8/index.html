<h2 id="deep-remixability">Deep remixability</h2>

<p>When previously separate mediums are being combined in various ways - not just by format, but by technique, culture, and other meta-characteristics as well.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="variable-form">Variable form</h2>

<p>A motion graphic sequence that never holds all its aspects static for long - some part of it is constantly in flux at some point in time.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="continuity-turn">Continuity turn</h2>

<p>The shift from discrete cuts and marked delimitations to continuous, gradual changes in motion graphic sequences. This is largely caused by the technological capacity to generate graphical changes through procedural modification of variables.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="metamedium">Metamedium</h2>

<p>Term suggested by Alan Kay in the 1970s describing the computer as a medium that encompasses the format, techniques, and expressive possibilities of all preceding mediums, as well future mediums, thanks to its capabilities as an automated turing machine.</p>

<p><br>
A piece of work that represents all these terms would be Monster Movie by Takeshi Murata. His work combines old-school, practical effect horror films with the contemporary process of datamoshing. The datamosh effect causes colorful visual shapes to jump and change constantly. Distinct cuts are also hard to pinpoint due to lingering visual artefacts between sequences. It takes advantage of the digital metamedium by importing film and audio work from prior sources, as well as applying generated effects.</p>
