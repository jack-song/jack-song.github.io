      <title>The Most Portable Ukulele in the World</title>

      <description>A few years ago, I started playing guitar at university and wanted to keep going when I moved around. My solution was to invest in a foldable Voyage Air guitar. It didn&amp;rsquo;t provide me with exactly the freedom and engineering satisfaction I was looking for: it was not truly foldable - it comes with a custom, oddly shaped backpack for carrying when packed away.
Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve always dreamed about just sawing a ukulele in half to take it to the extremes with no compromises.</description>

      <description>A gift that the previous owners of my home left. I didn&amp;rsquo;t think much of it until I watched the documentary California Typewriter on a flight! Brought it outside, cleaned it out, and now I have a nice, heavy, writing machine. I&amp;rsquo;m very lucky to have found it in working condition.
  This is the most similar model that I&amp;rsquo;ve found online, though the key labels seem slightly different. As a fan of mechanical keyboards already, using this typewriter is a joy.</description>

      <description>For the past 5 years, I&amp;rsquo;ve moved every 4 months. It&amp;rsquo;s taken time, but I&amp;rsquo;ve changed from a hoarder (the way of my people) to someone who wants very little. It was a gradual process, moving from 32&amp;rdquo; luggage to 28&amp;rdquo;, to a Kelty Redwing 50. I found myself cleaving away at my possessions with every move. I really didn&amp;rsquo;t use the vast majority of it and having stuff felt like a burden, mentally and physically.</description>

      <description>I just bought a used Fujifilm X70 in an attempt to save on space and weight. To keep chasing that goal, I made another change. Neck strap -&amp;gt; wrist strap -&amp;gt; finger strap. This is my take with the material I had lying around. I trimmed a simple velcro strap from some knock-off go-pro kit, and fitted it by trial and error:
        Comfortable, adjustable, and surprisingly secure.</description>

      <description>Farah&amp;rsquo;s original work: https://minddrewablank.wordpress.com/2017/07/04/moving-still/
Herd is an image constructed from video sourced from Planet Earth. It compresses an overhead shot of a herd of animals into a single frame, creating a textured blur with sporadic details. Inspired by Corinne Vionnet&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Photo Opportunities,&amp;rsquo; Farah&amp;rsquo;s piece mimics a long exposure photo using photoshop. The piece is dominated by soft browns and grays, with shadowy lines and blotches as the only recognizable features. Visually, it is well balanced and ambiguous, lacking constrasts and distinct shapes.</description>

      <description>Deep remixability When previously separate mediums are being combined in various ways - not just by format, but by technique, culture, and other meta-characteristics as well.

Variable form A motion graphic sequence that never holds all its aspects static for long - some part of it is constantly in flux at some point in time.

Continuity turn The shift from discrete cuts and marked delimitations to continuous, gradual changes in motion graphic sequences.</description>

      <description>The Mental Game reflects a moment of tension that everyone has experienced before. As a child, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s jumping down more steps than you&amp;rsquo;ve ever tried. As a teenager, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s clicking &amp;ldquo;submit&amp;rdquo; on an application that will decide your future. As an adult, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s stepping into a class far out of your comfort zone. In a single moment, instinctual hesitation kicks in. Time seems to slow down and you feel separated from the world.</description>

      <description>Constructed Narrative When the contents of a photograph have been artificially created by the artist in some way to reflect a narrative, rather than simply photographing a real scene. An example is A Sudden Gust of Wind (after Hokusai), taken by Jeff Wall, portraying the same narrative as the woodcut that inspired the work. The photograph was constructed digitally from various pieces.
http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/wall-a-sudden-gust-of-wind-after-hokusai-t06951

Tableau A photograph where the scene is assembled and actors are used to produce a certain result.</description>

      <description>Camera and Mic highlights the relationship between digital media and our physical senses. The piece prompts the viewer to recognize a pattern among 3 images.
The glitch highlights the eyes and ears to build an association with the title of the piece, suggesting that cameras and microphones imitate the eyes and ears. However, glitches are an explicit piece of evidence showing that these devices are not perfect. The presence of the glitches suggest a disconnect in how information is captured, though we frequently consume digital media as an illusionary extension of our own senses.</description>

      <description>A world with people:   
And a world without:   
Indexical A characteristic of images that implies a mapping to the original real world subject. Some relationship between the two is suggested, such as the chemical reactions driven by light reflected from a subject in film photography. This characteristic is debated in digital photography as physical interaction is less apparent, and converted into numerical data.</description>

      <description>part 2
Configuration, security, and deployment with SQS were all as easy as expected, and IAM has been a great convenience. It was also pretty straight forward to write tasks for Celery - but successes are not interesting.
Celery does not play perfectly with SQS.
One source of struggle was having scheduled tasks, thanks to SQS limitations (mostly relating to timeouts). We were forced to use local scheduling solutions for timed output delivery - in this case, Advanced Python Scheduler.</description>

      <description>A Pure Glitch is an effect either produced without intention or without understanding the underlying cause and system. A Glitch-alike is an effect produced purposefully and with some form of reasoning about how the effect was created.
My attempts are shown in a separate post here.

Datamoshing Datamoshing is an effect based on the visual presentation of compression artefacts found in lossy file formats. For this reason, they are often shown in certain common formats like GIFs, JPEGs, or video.</description>

      <description>Making Waves is a short story about a boat in the small fishing town of Lamu, Kenya.
Fishing has always been a mainstay in Lamu, but never the focus. It used to be a thriving port in the center of East African sea trade. Now it&amp;rsquo;s a UNESCO World Heritage site, relying on the tourism and investment of foreigners. However, the story isn&amp;rsquo;t over yet and nearby, one of the largest ports in East Africa is currently being built by Chinese corporations (Weitere).</description>

      <description>Stereography A technique to generate a sense of depth in a visualization by presenting a different image to each eye. Mimics the way humans naturally perceive depth in every day life. Various techniques have been used, ranging from mechanical devices working with film photographs to polarized light in a 3D movie. Can be a highly effective technique, but usually requires a fairly complex mechanism. This may affect the experience of the viewer.</description>

Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve understood that I like &amp;ldquo;doing art&amp;rdquo; because I enjoy creating and telling stories. I like building flavorful worlds and presenting compellling characters. I like the idea of reaching into people with stories.</description>

      <description>part 1
Our data pipeline needs a message broker for a Celery job queue; RabbitMQ and Amazon SQS are two good choices. They are designed to scale, guarantee message delivery, and seem to have good support.
RabbitMQ has a solid reputation as a broker, with diverse and robust features. It works very well with Celery. The only real disadvantage is that it relies on custom configuration and deployment. SQS is a message queue as a service, self-scaling and configurable from a web UI.</description>

      <description>At my work, we&amp;rsquo;re building a pipeline to provide data-driven feedback to users.
The de-facto king for data is Python, thanks to its community. A common way to deploy these models is via a Flask application, but this isn&amp;rsquo;t a good fit for every case. What if the service doesn&amp;rsquo;t need a front end? What if clients don&amp;rsquo;t want to wait for a potentially long operation? What if our business requirements are still uncertain, and we anticipate a need to scale?</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s definitely overwhelming&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; assurances come from many of the people I meet. They&amp;rsquo;re consistently impressed that I&amp;rsquo;m so new to the African continent. Expats and locals are the same. They&amp;rsquo;re excited for my stay here, and equally sympathetic about the culture shock.
I landed after a 24 hour itinerary carrying my 50L backpack. I said no to a border official asking for a tip. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell if it was supposed to be a bribe and he didn&amp;rsquo;t even fill in my form correctly.</description>

      <description>I am currently working on an app for Kenyan users, with validation for local phone numbers. We use google&amp;rsquo;s libphonenumber library. While testing, I realized that my Kenyan number was considered invalid.
I check the source code and searched for &amp;ldquo;kenya&amp;rdquo;: &amp;ldquo;Prefix 25476 added for Airtel Kenya based on open-source bug report [&amp;hellip;] other prefixes from Wikipedia.&amp;rdquo; I take a look and Wikipedia does not contain a prefix for my number.</description>
