      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now I know a little more about making jumps and taking hard landings.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class=&#34;b-lazy&#34; src=&#34;http://whoisjack.today/assets/load.png&#34; data-src=&#34;/assets/blog/shock/plane.jpg&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s definitely overwhelming&amp;rdquo; - assurances came from many of the people I&amp;rsquo;ve met. They&amp;rsquo;re consistently impressed that I&amp;rsquo;m so new to the African continent. Expats and locals are the same. They&amp;rsquo;re excited for my stay here, and equally sympathetic about the culture shock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I landed after a 24 hour itinerary carrying my 50L backpack. I said no to a border official asking for a tip. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell if it was supposed to be a bribe and he didn&amp;rsquo;t even fill the form in correctly. I rushed into an Uber because the driver was yelling &amp;ldquo;faster, faster!&amp;rdquo; He laughed as we sped away. He said that a policeman was walking over, likely looking for trouble. While I unpack at my new home I realize I&amp;rsquo;ve caught a cold. The jet lag didn&amp;rsquo;t help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class=&#34;b-lazy&#34; src=&#34;http://whoisjack.today/assets/load.png&#34; data-src=&#34;/assets/blog/shock/road.jpg&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to think I&amp;rsquo;ve had it rough but it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been too bad, just unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Culture shock is real, and things are very different around here. There are power outages. There&amp;rsquo;s a drought, which means water outages. The faces I see everywhere are what not what I&amp;rsquo;m used to. Private property is always gated and every mall enforces security checks. Doctors have been on a nation-wide strike for over a month now. These things reminded me that I was traveling and I took them in stride. Because I like traveling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the smaller things that tired me out. Being out of breath at the top of a staircase because it&amp;rsquo;s 1,600m above sea level. Wondering if the way I say &amp;ldquo;mambo&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;asante&amp;rdquo; sound empty. Supressing my feelings of concern every time a soldier walks by with a rifle. These small things made me anxious for the next day. The anxiety was kind of fun, but this is not a vacation getaway, it&amp;rsquo;s a 4 month stay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than usual, I&amp;rsquo;d want to spend some weekend days at home, doing nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class=&#34;b-lazy&#34; src=&#34;http://whoisjack.today/assets/load.png&#34; data-src=&#34;/assets/blog/shock/room.jpg&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew that I would get used to it eventually. It felt like waiting for the day you finally feel better after being sick. I also knew that it could take a very long time to get over, or that I might never adjust completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized that the expats I meet have had similar experiences, or are currently going through it. We&amp;rsquo;re not the only ones either and I definitely haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the worst of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I admire the millions of people going through this process right now; they have bet their livelihoods on it. They&amp;rsquo;re in a gamble to write personal legends. Stakes are high and enduring the shock of a new world is only a small part of the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>RTFM</title>
      <link>http://whoisjack.today/blog/2017-01-24-RTFM/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought I had found a flaw in the great google machine - instead I learned that &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/JakeWharton/status/806344184999399424&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;libraries are innocent until proven guilty&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am currently working on an app for Kenyan users, with validation for local phone numbers. We use google&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber&#34;&gt;libphonenumber&lt;/a&gt; library. While testing, I realized that my Kenyan number was considered invalid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I check the source code and searched for &amp;ldquo;kenya&amp;rdquo;: &amp;ldquo;Prefix 25476 added for Airtel Kenya based on open-source bug report [&amp;hellip;] other prefixes from Wikipedia.&amp;rdquo; I take a look and Wikipedia does not contain a prefix for my number. Everything made sense - my number was recently issued. There&amp;rsquo;s no way google has the resources to keep up with all the technical changes in the world - and certainly not in Kenya where documentation is poor and growth is fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I regretfully hammer out a horrific switch case method to validate phone numbers instead of using the library - we did not have time to wait for a fix. But as I go to file a bug report, I read the guidelines: &amp;ldquo;Is the issue reproducible using the demo? [&amp;hellip;] Your issue may be resolved by upgrading to the latest version of the library.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try my Kenyan number in the online demo. It&amp;rsquo;s valid. Searching the issues gives &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/issues/804&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. I rollback and update the library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So even if you&amp;rsquo;re in a volatile domain - give the library the benefit of the doubt and first RTFM. I guess I could at least submit a change to Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An argument can also be made that in a domain &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; volatile, it could be wise to use a less strict form of validation in the first place, depending the importance of the features vs. handling illegal values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bonus: A telecommunication giant using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/SafaricomLtd/posts/10156369539590084&#34;&gt;facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/safaricomltd/status/633134928536932352&#34;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt; as technical communication channels&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least they&amp;rsquo;re responsive!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
