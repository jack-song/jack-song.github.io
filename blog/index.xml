      <description>&lt;p&gt;How it feels to have poor judgement and butterfingers&amp;hellip; again.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those of us that don&amp;rsquo;t pay attention to history are doomed to repeat it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 year ago: I&amp;rsquo;m on exchange, and life is fun. We travel as if we could actually afford it. I have a waterproof camera, my trusty blue Panasonic Lumix TS5, because GoPros are way out of my budget. Next to cross off the list is Bali.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img

    data-src=&#34;/assets/blog/losing/bali.jpg&#34;&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re all excited to try surfing. I have a blast and learn that it&amp;rsquo;s really hard. The water is cold and the waves are relentless. It&amp;rsquo;s tiring just to walk out to catch a breaker. Standing up, balancing, and then wiping out is one of the greatest thrills I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img 
    class=&#34;lazyload&#34; 
    src=&#34;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&#34; 
    data-src=&#34;/assets/blog/losing/surfings.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;noscript&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;http://whoisjack.today/assets/blog/losing/surfings.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decide to bring my waterproof camera with me in my pocket. As I pull myself out of the water, it&amp;rsquo;s gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;denial&#34;&gt;Denial&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I check my pockets. Nothing. But they&amp;rsquo;re really big pockets - maybe they&amp;rsquo;re deeper down there? I look back out at the sea. Maybe. I duck my head underwater and feel around. Just maybe, I lost the camera right here, in this exact spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;anger&#34;&gt;Anger&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m an idiot. Why did I think this was a good idea? I slowly wade out to catch another wave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;bargaining&#34;&gt;Bargaining&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This must be punishment for me being an ass on the mountain that night. What if I just search for the rest of the day? It&amp;rsquo;s not like the ocean is that big, or the water moves that much, or the camera is blue. Trying to stand on my board, I wipe out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;depression&#34;&gt;Depression&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve lost so many pictures! Our entire group had photos on it and I&amp;rsquo;ve let the team down. Deep in their hearts, they&amp;rsquo;ll never forgive me  :&amp;lsquo;(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;acceptance&#34;&gt;Acceptance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surfing was really fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img 
    class=&#34;lazyload&#34; 
    src=&#34;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&#34; 
    data-src=&#34;/assets/blog/losing/beach.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;noscript&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;http://whoisjack.today/assets/blog/losing/beach.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to the present: I&amp;rsquo;m taking a matatu to meet some Kenyan friends. It&amp;rsquo;s sunny in dry season Nairobi so I bring my sweet, sweet NASA hat. My old faithful has been with me ever since I fulfilled my dream of visiting the Kennedy Space Center during my second coop term. I wore the copper, denim, and leather with pride. The matatu is hot so I leave it on my lap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img 
    class=&#34;lazyload&#34; 
    src=&#34;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&#34; 
    data-src=&#34;/assets/blog/losing/matatu.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;noscript&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;http://whoisjack.today/assets/blog/losing/matatu.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time I&amp;rsquo;m almost at my friend&amp;rsquo;s place, I notice that I don&amp;rsquo;t have it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;denial-1&#34;&gt;Denial&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dropped it on the ground walking from the matatu right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;anger-1&#34;&gt;Anger&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did I not notice it dropping from my lap? Why did I not just put it in my bag? I stew as I walk back to where I got off, staring at the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img 
    class=&#34;lazyload&#34; 
    src=&#34;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&#34; 
    data-src=&#34;/assets/blog/losing/hills.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;noscript&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;http://whoisjack.today/assets/blog/losing/hills.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;bargaining-1&#34;&gt;Bargaining&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I kept taking matatu for the rest of the day, could I find the right one? Maybe if I wait here diligently, the driver will come back to give me my hat. The lady running the nearby fried banana stand asks if I&amp;rsquo;m ok. I cover up the pain and say I&amp;rsquo;m fine, I&amp;rsquo;m just checking if I&amp;rsquo;m on the right street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;depression-1&#34;&gt;Depression&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That hat was amazing, I&amp;rsquo;ll never get the same one again. It was a loyal friend and I betrayed it. I even made a hat-trade with Adam Savage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img 
    class=&#34;lazyload&#34; 
    src=&#34;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&#34; 
    data-src=&#34;/assets/blog/losing/savage.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;noscript&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;http://whoisjack.today/assets/blog/losing/savage.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;acceptance-1&#34;&gt;Acceptance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey this giraffe hat is pretty sweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 4 years of university, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned to leave a lot of things behind. I brought only a carry-on for my 4 month stay in Kenya. I idolize the idea that all I need in life are my wits and skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I lose a practical possession, I barely care. Though sometimes I struggle to cope, I try to treat losing sentimental items the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll lose my memories with or without trinkets to anchor them. I&amp;rsquo;m a forgetful person. Even as I write this post, I have to fabricate details. These hard earned stories will soon sink into the back of my mind, becoming an anonymous piece of me. And I will be distracted by a new story. Lose, forget, change &amp;mdash; and repeat.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Shock</title>
      <link>http://whoisjack.today/blog/2017-02-08-Shock/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://whoisjack.today/blog/2017-02-08-Shock/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now I know a little more about making jumps and taking hard landings.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img 
    class=&#34;lazyload&#34; 
    src=&#34;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&#34; 
    data-src=&#34;/assets/blog/shock/plane.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;noscript&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;http://whoisjack.today/assets/blog/shock/plane.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s definitely overwhelming&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; assurances come from many of the people I meet. They&amp;rsquo;re consistently impressed that I&amp;rsquo;m so new to the African continent. Expats and locals are the same. They&amp;rsquo;re excited for my stay here, and equally sympathetic about the culture shock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I landed after a 24 hour itinerary carrying my 50L backpack. I said no to a border official asking for a tip. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell if it was supposed to be a bribe and he didn&amp;rsquo;t even fill in my form correctly. I rushed into an Uber because the driver was yelling &amp;ldquo;faster, faster!&amp;rdquo; He laughed as we sped away. He said that a policeman was walking over and looking for trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I unpack at my new home I realize I&amp;rsquo;ve caught a cold. The jet lag didn&amp;rsquo;t help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img 
    class=&#34;lazyload&#34; 
    src=&#34;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&#34; 
    data-src=&#34;/assets/blog/shock/road.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;noscript&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;http://whoisjack.today/assets/blog/shock/road.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to think I&amp;rsquo;ve had it rough but it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been too bad, just unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Culture shock is real, and things are very different around here. There are power outages. There&amp;rsquo;s a drought, which means water outages. The faces I see everywhere are what not what I&amp;rsquo;m used to. Private property is always gated and every mall enforces security checks. Doctors have been on a nation-wide strike for over a month now. These things reminded me that I was traveling and I took them in stride. Because I like traveling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The small things tired me out. Things like being out of breath at the top of a staircase because it&amp;rsquo;s 1,600m above sea level. Wondering if the way I say &amp;ldquo;mambo&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;asante&amp;rdquo; sound empty. Supressing my feelings of concern every time a soldier walks by with a rifle. These things made me anxious for the next day. It was a fun kind of anxiety but this was yet another step up from the places I&amp;rsquo;ve been to before. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t a weekend getaway and this new world would be home for four months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than usual, I wanted to spend some weekend days at home, doing nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img 
    class=&#34;lazyload&#34; 
    src=&#34;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&#34; 
    data-src=&#34;/assets/blog/shock/room.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;noscript&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;http://whoisjack.today/assets/blog/shock/room.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It felt like waiting for the day you finally feel better after being sick. Of course, I fought my instincts and pushed myself to make plans. I would adapt eventually. I also knew that it could take a very long time to get over, or that I might never adjust completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I did stuff. I hiked, climbed rocks, and did yoga. I went to events, had dinners, and met people. I hung around the kitchen to make small talk with my roomates. I had beers and struck up awkward conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immersing myself in everything really pushed things along. As I saw more of the city and heard the stories of more people, I became comfortable. It also helped to realize that the expats I met have had similar experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re not the only ones. Immigrating as a child, I&amp;rsquo;ve never given much thought to the feelings my family had to cope with and the courage they built. The small taste I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten still can&amp;rsquo;t begin to compare to their challenges. Knowing this, my admiration continues to grow for the millions of people going through this process right now. They&amp;rsquo;re in a gamble to write personal legends and some have bet their lives on it. Stakes are high and enduring the shock of a new world is only a small part of the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>http://whoisjack.today/blog/2017-01-24-RTFM/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 24 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://whoisjack.today/blog/2017-01-24-RTFM/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought I had found a flaw in the great google machine - instead I learned that &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/JakeWharton/status/806344184999399424&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;libraries are innocent until proven guilty&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am currently working on an app for Kenyan users, with validation for local phone numbers. We use google&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber&#34;&gt;libphonenumber&lt;/a&gt; library. While testing, I realized that my Kenyan number was considered invalid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I check the source code and searched for &amp;ldquo;kenya&amp;rdquo;: &amp;ldquo;Prefix 25476 added for Airtel Kenya based on open-source bug report [&amp;hellip;] other prefixes from Wikipedia.&amp;rdquo; I take a look and Wikipedia does not contain a prefix for my number. Everything made sense - my number was recently issued. There&amp;rsquo;s no way google has the resources to keep up with all the technical changes in the world - and certainly not in Kenya where documentation is poor and growth is fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I regretfully hammer out a horrific switch case method to validate phone numbers instead of using the library - we did not have time to wait for a fix. But as I go to file a bug report, I read the guidelines: &amp;ldquo;Is the issue reproducible using the demo? [&amp;hellip;] Your issue may be resolved by upgrading to the latest version of the library.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try my Kenyan number in the online demo. It&amp;rsquo;s valid. Searching the issues gives &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/issues/804&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. I rollback and update the library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So even if you&amp;rsquo;re in a volatile domain - give the library the benefit of the doubt and first RTFM. I guess I could at least submit a change to Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An argument can also be made that in a domain &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; volatile, it could be wise to use a less strict form of validation in the first place, depending the importance of the features vs. handling illegal values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bonus: A telecommunication giant using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/SafaricomLtd/posts/10156369539590084&#34;&gt;facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/safaricomltd/status/633134928536932352&#34;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt; as technical communication channels&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least they&amp;rsquo;re responsive!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
