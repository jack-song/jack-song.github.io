      <div class="serif-font later"><p><a href="http://bikekitchen.org/">The San Francisco Bike Kitchen</a> is where you find mechanical magic. This local non-profit, run by volunteers, offers a build-a-bike program for $40. This lets you build a bike with the used parts lying around the Kitchen. From frames to wheels to handlebars, patience is all that&rsquo;s needed to assemble a custom ride.</p>
<p>I fully intended to bike everywhere when I moved to SF, and even picked an apartment location that would let me do that. I found myself visiting the Bike Kitchen within a week of moving in, and spent a prodigious amount of time there for the next 2 months. Building a complete, functional bike with my own hands was an idea that deeply spoke to the engineer, craftsman, and artist in me. I was rewarded with a beautiful friend that now follows me everywhere I go.</p>

<p>I was committed to building a fixed gear bike of my own (one of the volunteers warned that it would be 20+ hours of work), and Murphy&rsquo;s law hit hard. I ended up reworking nearly every inch of it. And I loved every second that I spent struggling.</p>
<p>The first real challenge was choosing a frame. This was the biggest decision to make, and would impact how the rest of the entire build would pan out. I had to balance many constraints, some of which I had just started learning about. The bike had to fit me well. It had to either already have a fixed gear hub, or be able to accept one. I had to love the look. Sturdy, but light. Brands, lugging, butting, forks, material, dropouts. It went on and on.</p>

<p>This black fixed gear bike was donated while I was in the Kitchen one day. It was tempting but I was on the fence about the quality of the material and didn&rsquo;t want to deal with removing the stickers. Despite it already being a functional bike, I decided to take the fixed gear back wheel instead, with some remorse. I felt like I should have given the bike thanks for its life of service. Its legacy will live on through its parts. 4+ hours.</p>

<p>Time skip! Unfortunately, I was engrossed with the work and did not take enough photos. I ended up picking a very pretty frame by &ldquo;Normano Milano&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve found a grand total of <a href="https://www.bikeforums.net/classic-vintage/1012755-normano.html">2 mentions of this brand on the internet, both on bikeforums.net</a>. They indicate that this is likely a B-line branch off of Bianchi in the 50s or 60s. Some speckled rust had formed on the blue and chrome, in a pleasing way, and someone had carved what seems like an SSN into the top bar. Just quirky enough for my tastes. The frame didn&rsquo;t seem overly heavy despite its age, there was a matching fork, and someone had previously liked it enough to throw on a Shimano 600 crankset. I installed the back wheel that I had harvested and picked up a front wheel and Grand Randonneur handlebars that seemed comfy and matched the aesthetic. 2+ hours.</p>

<p>Struggle #1: I had a 16 tooth sprocket, and wanted to find a suitable chainring for my only gear ratio. 45 seemed perfect, especially for skid patches, but just wouldn&rsquo;t fit on the crank arm. On the advice of Deming, who often operates the Kitchen, I ended up hand filing the chainring. Seems safe enough. 2+ hours.</p>

<p>I was lucky enough to find that the chainring and sprocket lined up! I even found a wide, used chain that wasn&rsquo;t too worn. Cleaned it up and threw it on. 1+ hours.</p>

<p>This seat post gave me hell. The frame did not fit anything the Kitchen had. It was a very thin diameter, closer to 24.8mm. Insanity. I ended up realizing that the frame was essentially shimmed to this diameter by the original manufacturer. You could feel the metal ring that was bonded into the inside. I hand filed it out until the thinnest seat post I could find was able to fit. 3+ hours.</p>

<p>First rideable state! I was ecstatic for days. Ended up trialing a bunch of fits, cycling (heh) through a bunch of handlebar positions and seats. The first seat I tried seemed to fit the best, but ended up getting snatched by someone else. So it goes. I was digging the look of this suede seat but there was just too much friction. Also tried a bunch of pedal options. And stems. 2+ hours.</p>

<p>I wanted at least front brakes, and possibly even back brakes. I loved the chrome aesthetic and tried bare handlebar + unhooded drop breaks for a while. Didn&rsquo;t work out and forgot to take pictures too. I was also having trouble finding nice calipers that had a long enough reach and a long enough bolt. Ended up catching some nice Zeus-2001s that fit decently! However, the threading on the bolt was weird - it was the same as as the threading on Presta valves. I actually ended up using 2 nuts intended to secure valves to hold the brake. Seems safe enough. 3+ hours.</p>

<p>Surprise! The bike fits 27&quot; inch wheels, not 700c as I had assumed. Had to find a new set of wheels. Front was easy enough to find and definitely helped with the fit of the brake. Friend who I convinced to also build a bike is featured in the background. I was also starting to feel some trouble in the bottom bracket and headset. Ended up taking both apart and replacing all the bearings and some spacers. 4+ hours.</p>

<p>The old hub on the rear wheel was also giving me trouble. Solution? Build a new wheel. I saw this as an opportunity and took the wheel building class, also offered by the Bike Kitchen. Unfortunately, with the combination of hubs and rims available, I ended up building another 700c, not 27&quot;. At least it&rsquo;s a shiny blue aero rim! 5+ hours.</p>
<p>The running total? 26 hours or more, so far. The volunteers definitely know what they&rsquo;re talking about :). I would one day like a 27&quot; back wheel. I&rsquo;ve also been feeling a bit of friction from the bottom bracket and hearing some clicking&hellip;</p>
