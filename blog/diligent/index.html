      <div class="serif-font fade-in later"><p>After burning through a ton of habit apps, I felt like most of them &ldquo;miss the point&rdquo;. They focus on aesthetics and basic features like streaks, without considering the human context and difficulties in solving the problem of &ldquo;how do I build and sustain the best habits for my life&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I wanted something designed from the ground up that would embrace the fact that lives are constantly in flux, and in some ways, our habits should be too. It should be ok, and even encouraged, to drop some habits to try something new. I wanted an app that would remind me of what science says is the best way to fight our unproductive tendencies.</p>
<p>Hence: <a href="https://practicediligence.com/">https://practicediligence.com/</a></p>
<h2 id="v3">V3</h2>
<p>Working on providing more structure and guidance to the app, as well as &ldquo;bells and whistles&rdquo; that make it a pleasant experience. Unfortunately Notifications API doesn&rsquo;t work for Safari yet. Still need to improve the sync behavior (or at least UX). Want to re-design a very lightweight onboarding. Still need to make it easier for users to &ldquo;install.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="v2">V2</h2>
<p>Focused on getting accounts to work across devices. Went with Firebase auth, pouchDB, and IBM Cloudant for very hands-off account and data management. Worked pretty well overall. Hardest part is figuring out how to effectively manage synchronization of live data in an offline-first approach.</p>
<p>Tried an onboarding experience that wasn&rsquo;t quite right, and a bit too heavyweight. I like the idea of the app being results focused, but need to take it back to the drawing board because the UX was too clunky.</p>
<h2 id="v1">V1</h2>
<p>Focused on editing flexibility and ease of logging. Found a good library for the tree-based UI (<code>react-sortly</code>). Deployed and started using on my phone.</p>

<p><strong><em>Working notes. <a href="#top"> Click here go back up.</a></em></strong></p>
<p>2022-02-04: Default tree that gives a bit more guidance. Indicator for &ldquo;overnight&rdquo; of the same day. Re-write the info panes. Don&rsquo;t auto collapse tree on tap. Add very basic &ldquo;streak&rdquo; visualization.</p>
