        <h2 id="constructed-narrative">Constructed Narrative</h2>
<p>When the contents of a photograph have been artificially created by the artist in some way to reflect a narrative, rather than simply photographing a real scene. An example is A Sudden Gust of Wind (after Hokusai), taken by Jeff Wall, portraying the same narrative as the woodcut that inspired the work. The photograph was constructed digitally from various pieces.</p>

## Tableau
A photograph where the scene is assembled and actors are used to produce a certain result. An example is The Basement, by Gregory Crewdson. Actors, an arranged set, and lighting are used to make a lazy, warm, and crisp basement image.

## Re-enactment
A re-enactment is an image that aims to reproduce a past historical event. An example is Diary of a Victorian Dandy, which portrays a gathering of wealthy Victorians in an opulent room, taken in 1998.

## Uncanny
A work has an uncanny characterstic if it is similar to something else, but with subtle, unsettling differences. An example would be Bram Stokerâ€™s Chair, by Sam Taylor-Johnson. The image clearly depicts a situation that is physically possible, but feels fake. The timing of the picture seems highly coincidential and the chair appears to lack a shadow, generating doubt in the viewer.
