        <p>For the past 5 years, I&rsquo;ve moved every 4 months. It&rsquo;s taken time, but I&rsquo;ve changed from a hoarder (the way of my people) to someone who wants very little. It was a gradual process, moving from 32&rdquo; luggage to 28&rdquo;, to a Kelty Redwing 50. I found myself cleaving away at my possessions with every move. I really didn&rsquo;t use the vast majority of it and having <strong>stuff</strong> felt like a burden, mentally and physically. I eventually found my way to communities like <em>r/onebag</em> and <em>r/minimalism</em> and <em>r/ultralight</em>.</p>

<p>At first glance, this way of life seemed to be about just having less stuff. 0 is the ideal we worship. Every gram counts. Logical, practical, easy to see progress, good for the environment, fight consumerism! etc. etc.</p>

<p>But with another look, it&rsquo;s really about planning. Understanding your situation/trip and knowing what you need. No person&rsquo;s perfect bag is another&rsquo;s. No two trips have the same perfect gear list. This is a frequent reminder that community members give. This way of life is about effective and custom optimization.</p>

<p>I put this to the test on a one month trip to Japan with a 20L pack weighing in at &lt; 7kg. I thought it would be straightforward: no winter conditions, urban travel. Bring the best and lightest gear for (at most) a strong chill, and some farm work (<em>WWOOF</em> is a <sup>11</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> experience by the way, highly recommended). But as I started to collect things, I realized that packing less was more than effective planning.</p>

<p>Packing less is a concrete exercise in deciding on my life priorities and identity.</p>

<p>We usually need to account for external constraints when we plan any part of our lives. What are the social expectations? What do my family and friends want? What do I need to be ready for? These constraints are relaxed when we backpack - we can focus more on the internal components of our lives. What kind of activities will I want to do? How do I want to present myself? Which comforts can I forego? Of course these same decisions are being made all the time, but when they are mixed in with external influences, they are easily glossed over.</p>

<p>Backpacking is a situation where the reduction of external social constraints and addition of physical constraints magnifies the weight of these choices. I remember having an identity crises over the decision to cover a logo on my backpack with a patch of the Canadian flag. I opted to color the logo black to match the bag material instead.</p>

<p>Having said that, here are some things I learned by the end of the trip.</p>

<ul>
<li>20L (though I suspect stretchable up to 30L) really is enough for my comfort, despite being scared about it before leaving.</li>
<li>I dislike re-organizing and hope to never fill up my base pack to more than <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> full again.</li>
<li>Quick dry clothing is a game changer when I&rsquo;m sleeping in a different place each night.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s hard to Ignore thoughts like &ldquo;well it&rsquo;d be nice to&hellip;&rdquo;. Assume that every item could result in an over packed bag.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the space I could have saved. I thought the bandana and drawstring bag were fairly useless at this point in the trip, but became immensely useful later and take up very little weight and space - they&rsquo;re keepers. Currently searching for a more comfortable, sling variation of the drawstring bag!</p>

<p>Things I should have left / replaced in some way:</p>

<ul>
<li>E-reader. I should focus more on producing vs consuming while traveling - I&rsquo;ll likely write more about this later.</li>
<li>Laptop. Did not get work done as I had hoped.</li>
<li>Camera. EM-10 with a 1.7 25mm Panasonic was very bulky and I&rsquo;m not as much of a &ldquo;photographer&rdquo; as I thought.</li>
<li>Branded exercise shirts. I care about a clean presentation more than I expected.</li>
<li>Headphones. I didn&rsquo;t need as much &ldquo;isolation&rdquo; as I expected, and earphones with a good seal would have sufficed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Coming back from this trip, I immediately initiated a deep clean of my room, the first in over 5 years, that resulted in more than half the contained material being ejected. It&rsquo;s nice to be able to see the floor and walls.</p>

<p>Next iteration: one month in China, 20L, &lt; 6kg (hopefully).</p>
