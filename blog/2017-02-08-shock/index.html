      <h2>
          Shock
      </h2>

      <p>Now I know a little more about making jumps and taking hard landings.
</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s overwhelming&rdquo; - assurances from many of the people I&rsquo;ve met. They&rsquo;re consistently impressed that I&rsquo;m so new to the African continent. Expats and locals are the same. They&rsquo;re excited for my stay here, and equally sympathetic about the culture shock.</p>

<p>I came in hot, finishing a 24 hour flight iterary with my four-month-stay backpack. I said no to a border official asking for a tip (bribe? he didn&rsquo;t even fill the form in correctly). I jumped really fast into an Uber because the driver was yelling &ldquo;faster, faster!&rdquo; He laughed as we sped away. He says that a policeman was coming, looking for trouble. While I unpack at my new home I realize I&rsquo;m sick. The jet lag didn&rsquo;t help.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to think I&rsquo;ve had it rough but it hasn&rsquo;t been too bad, just unexpected.</p>

<p>Culture shock is real, and things are very different around here. There are power outages. There&rsquo;s a drought - water outages. The faces I see everywhere and every day are what not what I&rsquo;m used to. I pass through a security check for every property I step onto. Doctors have been on a nation-wide strike for over a month now. These things told me that I was travelling and I took them in stride. Because I like travelling.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the smaller things that tired me out. Being out of breath at the top of a staircase because it&rsquo;s 1,600m above sea level. Wondering if the way I say &ldquo;mambo&rdquo; or &ldquo;asante&rdquo; sound empty. Containing my surprise every time I see a soldier with a rifle. These made the whole experience feel fresh and also made me anxious for the next day. The anxiety was kind of fun, but this is not a vacation getaway, or &ldquo;travelling&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t even have a flight out yet.</p>

<p>More than usual, I&rsquo;d want to spend some weekend days at home, doing nothing.</p>

<p>I knew that I would get used to all of it. It felt like waiting for the day you feel good after being sick in bed. For me, it&rsquo;s already happened, or happening, but I can&rsquo;t explain how or when. And I feel like I&rsquo;ve finally had a taste of what millions of people have bet their lives on. To write their own personal legends, some are willing to endure the shock of a new world.</p>
