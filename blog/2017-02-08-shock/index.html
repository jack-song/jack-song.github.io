      <h2>
          Shock
      </h2>

      <p>Now I know a little more about making jumps and taking hard landings.
</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s definitely overwhelming&rdquo; - assurances came from many of the people I&rsquo;ve met. They&rsquo;re consistently impressed that I&rsquo;m so new to the African continent. Expats and locals are the same. They&rsquo;re excited for my stay here, and equally sympathetic about the culture shock.</p>

<p>I landed after a 24 hour flight iterary carrying my 50L backpack. I said no to a border official asking for a tip. I couldn&rsquo;t tell if it was supposed to be a bribe and he didn&rsquo;t even fill the form in correctly. I rushed into an Uber because the driver was yelling &ldquo;faster, faster!&rdquo; He laughed as we sped away. He said that a policeman was walking over, likely looking for trouble. While I unpack at my new home I realize I&rsquo;ve caught a cold. The jet lag didn&rsquo;t help.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to think I&rsquo;ve had it rough but it hasn&rsquo;t been too bad, just unexpected.</p>

<p>Culture shock is real, and things are very different around here. There are power outages. There&rsquo;s a drought - water outages. The faces I see everywhere are what not what I&rsquo;m used to. Private property is always gated and every mall enforces security checks. Doctors have been on a nation-wide strike for over a month now. These things reminded me that I was travelling and I took them in stride. Because I like travelling.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the smaller things that tired me out. Being out of breath at the top of a staircase because it&rsquo;s 1,600m above sea level. Wondering if the way I say &ldquo;mambo&rdquo; or &ldquo;asante&rdquo; sound empty. Supressing my feelings of concern every time a soldier walks by with a rifle. These small things made me anxious for the next day. The anxiety was kind of fun, but this is not a vacation getaway, it&rsquo;s a 4 month stay.</p>

<p>More than usual, I&rsquo;d want to spend some weekend days at home, doing nothing.</p>

<p>I knew that I would get used to it eventually. It felt like waiting for the day you finally feel better after being sick. I also knew that it could take a very long time, or never quite finish completely.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know when, but I think I&rsquo;ve already gotten used to most of it. I also realized that the expats I meet have already gone though a similar process, or are currently working through it. Some could be caught in much more difficult circumstances than what I&rsquo;ve seen. Still, we probably have it relatively easy.</p>

<p>I admire the millions of immigrants around the world going through this process right now; they have bet their livelihoods on it. They&rsquo;re in a gamble to write personal legends. Stakes are high and enduring the shock of a new world is only a small part of the challenge.</p>
