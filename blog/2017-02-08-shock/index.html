        <p>Now I know a little more about making jumps and taking hard landings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s definitely overwhelming&rdquo; &mdash; assurances come from many of the people I meet. They&rsquo;re consistently impressed that I&rsquo;m so new to the African continent. Expats and locals are the same. They&rsquo;re excited for my stay here, and equally sympathetic about the culture shock.</p>

<p>I landed after a 24 hour itinerary carrying my 50L backpack. I said no to a border official asking for a tip. I couldn&rsquo;t tell if it was supposed to be a bribe and he didn&rsquo;t even fill in my form correctly. I rushed into an Uber because the driver was yelling &ldquo;faster, faster!&rdquo; He laughed as we sped away. He said that a policeman was walking over and looking for trouble.</p>

<p>While I unpack at my new home I realize I&rsquo;ve caught a cold. The jet lag didn&rsquo;t help.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to think I&rsquo;ve had it rough but it hasn&rsquo;t been too bad, just unexpected.</p>

<p>Culture shock is real, and things are very different around here. There are power outages. There&rsquo;s a drought, which means water outages. The faces I see everywhere are what not what I&rsquo;m used to. Private property is always gated and every mall enforces security checks. Doctors have been on a nation-wide strike for over a month now. These things reminded me that I was traveling and I took them in stride. Because I like traveling.</p>

<p>The small things tired me out. Things like being out of breath at the top of a staircase because it&rsquo;s 1,600m above sea level. Wondering if the way I say &ldquo;mambo&rdquo; or &ldquo;asante&rdquo; sound empty. Supressing my feelings of concern every time a soldier walks by with a rifle. These things made me anxious for the next day. It was a fun kind of anxiety but this was yet another step up from the places I&rsquo;ve been to before. This wasn&rsquo;t a weekend getaway and this new world would be home for four months.</p>

<p>More than usual, I wanted to spend some weekend days at home, doing nothing.</p>

<div class="sz-row sz-breathe">

<p>It felt like waiting for the day you finally feel better after being sick. Of course, I fought my instincts and pushed myself to make plans. I would adapt eventually. I also knew that it could take a very long time to get over, or that I might never adjust completely.</p>

<p>So I did stuff. I hiked, climbed rocks, and did yoga. I went to events, had dinners, and met people. I hung around the kitchen to make small talk with my roomates. I had beers and struck up awkward conversations.</p>

<p>Immersing myself in everything really pushed things along. As I saw more of the city and heard the stories of more people, I became comfortable. It also helped to realize that the expats I met have had similar experiences.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re not the only ones. Immigrating as a child, I&rsquo;ve never given much thought to the feelings my family had to cope with and the courage they built. The small taste I&rsquo;ve gotten still can&rsquo;t begin to compare to their challenges. Knowing this, my admiration continues to grow for the millions of people going through this process right now. They&rsquo;re in a gamble to write personal legends and some have bet their lives on it. Stakes are high and enduring the shock of a new world is only a small part of the challenge.</p>
