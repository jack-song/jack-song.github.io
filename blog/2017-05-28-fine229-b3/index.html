      <div class="serif-font later"><p>A Pure Glitch is an effect either produced without intention or without understanding the underlying cause and system. A Glitch-alike is an effect produced purposefully and with some form of reasoning about how the effect was created.</p>
<p>My attempts are shown in a separate post <a href="../2017-05-28-cans">here</a>.</p>

### Datamoshing
Datamoshing is an effect based on the visual presentation of compression artefacts found in lossy file formats. For this reason, they are often shown in certain common formats like GIFs, JPEGs, or video.
<p>Some of these videos can be easily found on Youtube:

### Data bending / image bending
Data bending is a technique used to produce glitch effects by directly editing the file data in an unintentional way. This could include editing the data as ASCII text or by interpreting the file as a format that it was not intended for. An example is image bending by editing a BMP file as if it was a sound file.
<br>
### Hex editing
Hex editing is a file editing technique that changes the binary data making up a file directly, usually displayed in base-16, or "hex". This technique can be used to for data bending.
<p>There are often tools designed specifically for this purpose, such as FlexHex: <a href="http://www.flexhex.com/">http://www.flexhex.com/</a>.</p>
<br>
### Pixel sorting
An image-editing effect based on the action of grouping pixels that similarities. It usually creates a distinct and striped look along certain columns or rows where the technique was applied. The method was largely popularized by Kim Asendorf who created a program for this technique: http://kimasendorf.com/www/.</div>
