          Muscle Memory - Statement

Muscle Memory references the body and mind - two aspects of the human experience that have historically been prominent subjects in art. However, these ideas have been explored mostly separately - through works like illusions, impressionist paintings, or chronophotography. At a basic level, Muscle Memory is a challenge to merge them, breaking down prior boundaries.</p>

<p>I use the piece as a reflection of the many mechanisms that play important parts in the development of muscle memory, drawing from personal experience. Visually and in audio, the most obvious connection is with dreams. Dreams are produced during REM sleep, which learning and memory development is heavily reliant on. I try to build on the idea of information processing by overlaying a digital pattern, which fades away as learning takes effect and data is consolidated. The physicality of practice in the learning process can be seen in repeating sequences. It can also be sensed in the background metronome and periodic verbal counts.</p>

<p>The remix nature of the digital medium, as discussed by Lev Manovich, is also reflective of the tendency for the mind to create deep remixes, especially for the purpose of learning. The ability to reframe and rearrange ideas in fundamental ways is strongly tied to creativity in human brains. This concept is presented by Kirby Ferguson during his TED talk, <em>Creativity is a Remix</em>. This last stage of learning, where movements are internalized and used to generate novel ideas, is reflected in the construction of the piece itself, through the use of music procedurally generated by AI as the main background track.</p>
