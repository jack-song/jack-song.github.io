      <div class="serif-font later"><p>I take a lot of notes but don&rsquo;t seem to make use of them. I feel like I&rsquo;m leaving insight and ideas on the table. It should be possible to remix past thoughts and consumed media to create something new, like taking frozen leftovers out of the fridge once in a while to make a stew. Creativity basically boils down to connecting distant ideas. This is not covering new ground: quick research shows that Zettelkasten, Obsidian, and Smart Notes have tackled this &ldquo;second brain&rdquo; approach.</p>
<p>However, I do think the capacity for computers to not forget, have infinite attention, and pull informatio instantly is underleveraged. It&rsquo;s possible that our ability to forget and ignore vast amounts of information is the exact strength that&rsquo;s required for good creative thinking, but until that&rsquo;s proven, it&rsquo;s a fun idea to explore, and some kind of middle ground seems optimal. As Elon Musk has phrased eloquently, we&rsquo;re all already androids. Our personal devices, connected to internet, have become the newest and outer-most members of our cortex.</p>
<h2 id="v3">V3</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m curently using Obsidian to try out the &ldquo;good old manual&rdquo; approach to this problem for myself. At the same time, trying out more sophisticated ways of processing the raw text. This problem is classic NLP. Additionally, instead of interacting with live recommendations, a different workflow might make sense - a dedicated time to &ldquo;review&rdquo; notes, with the help of computer assistance. Bag of words and embeddings are all in the experimentation phase. Unfortunately, like with most data work, cleaning is half the job. My old notes suck. Trying to figure out a way around the garbage-in garbage-out effect is hard.</p>
<h2 id="v2">V2</h2>
<p>I built a simple local prototypes that records notes but acts as an auto-complete. Like naming a new file, it brings up previous notes with similar words. Problem: I&rsquo;ve noticed that it&rsquo;s difficult to write my note and evaluate the recommendations at the same time. It feels like a better return-on-effort is focusing on writing good notes (foreshadowing!). Another problem: the recommendations are bad and not helpful.</p>
<h2 id="v1">V1</h2>
<p>To make things more accessible, 2 years ago I started writing everything into a Google Sheets document. Easy to use, index, and search. Not bad, but became slow to edit and search. Main problem still unsolved - I rarely went back to review, connect, and mentally process ideas. Perhaps the solution is something interactive, that will draw some basic connections for you.</p>
