      <div class="serif-font fade-in later"><p>I take a lot of notes but don&rsquo;t make use of them. I feel like I&rsquo;m leaving insight on the table. It should be possible to remix thoughts and learnings to create something new, like taking frozen leftovers out of the fridge once in a while to make a stew. After all, creativity basically boils down to connecting distant ideas. This is not covering new ground: Zettelkasten, Obsidian, and Smart Notes have already tackled this &ldquo;second brain&rdquo; approach.</p>
<p>However, I do think the capacity for computers to not forget, have infinite attention, and pull information instantly is underleveraged. It&rsquo;s possible that our ability to forget and ignore vast amounts of information is the exact strength that&rsquo;s required for good creative thinking, but until that&rsquo;s proven, it&rsquo;s a fun idea to explore. Some kind of middle ground seems optimal since in some ways, we&rsquo;re already androids. Our personal devices, connected to internet, have become the newest and outer-most members of our cortex.</p>
<h2 id="v3">V3</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m curently using Obsidian to try out the &ldquo;good old manual&rdquo; approach to this problem.</p>
<p>Instead of interacting with live recommendations, a different workflow might make sense - a dedicated time to &ldquo;review&rdquo; linking suggestions. A basic script would suggest notes that could be linked, based on their content.</p>
<p>Trying to learn some classic NLP to tackle this. Unfortunately, like with most data work, cleaning is half the job. My old notes suck. Trying to figure out a way around the garbage-in garbage-out effect.</p>
<h2 id="v2">V2</h2>
<p>I built a simple local prototypes that records notes but acts as an auto-complete. Like naming a new file, it brings up previous notes with similar words. Problem: I&rsquo;ve noticed that it&rsquo;s difficult to write my note and evaluate the recommendations at the same time. It feels like a better return-on-effort is focusing on writing good notes (foreshadowing!). Another problem: the recommendations are bad and not helpful.</p>
<h2 id="v1">V1</h2>
<p>To make things more accessible, 2 years ago I started writing everything into a Google Sheets document. Easy to use, index, and search. Not bad, but became slow to edit and search. Main problem still unsolved - I rarely went back to review, connect, and mentally process ideas. Perhaps the solution is something interactive, that will draw some basic connections for you.</p>

<p>2022-02-01: Learning how to take more effective notes - titles, structure, and linking.</p>
<p>2022-01-31: Reading about the OG <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/,">https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/,</a> skimming <a href="https://forum.zettelkasten.de/,">https://forum.zettelkasten.de/,</a> and tweaking some of my Obsidian notes.</p>
<p>2022-01-30: Results still not great after some basic tweaks. Trying to break down and understand components of the problem better. Will do individual deep dives on: the data, data cleaning, the embeddings, similarity scores, and the power / purpose of linking. Will probably want to work backwards from the desired output. Use better filters on text, stopwords, document size. Sneaking suspicion that similarity skills may not be a good proxy for &ldquo;linkable ideas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2022-01-27: Information density feels a bit too low to give meaningful results. False negatives are already going to be very high for this kind of task, so we want to drop it as much as possible to minimize &ldquo;wasted time&rdquo; for a user. Will try finding similarities between entire notes as documents. &ldquo;Daily notes&rdquo; are challenging because they might relate to different subjects. Also need to filter out templated text.</p>
<p>Maybe rather than ranking &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; embeddings, this can be turned into a real learning model, using public Obsidian Publish sites, hyperlinked blogs, and exiting links in their own vault as training data.</p>
<p>2022-01-26: Fixed filtering and indexing bugs in test with GloVe embeddings. Going over results.</p>
