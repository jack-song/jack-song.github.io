      <div class="serif-font later"><p>Those of us that don&rsquo;t pay attention to history are doomed to repeat it.</p>
<p>1 year ago: I&rsquo;m on exchange, and life is fun. We travel as if we could actually afford it. I have a waterproof camera, my trusty blue Panasonic Lumix TS5, because GoPros are way out of my budget. Next to cross off the list is Bali.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re all excited to try surfing. I have a blast and learn that it&rsquo;s really hard. The water is cold and the waves are relentless. It&rsquo;s tiring just to walk out to catch a breaker. Standing up, balancing, and then wiping out is one of the greatest thrills I&rsquo;ve experienced.</p>

<p>I decide to bring my waterproof camera with me in my pocket. As I pull myself out of the water, it&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<h3 id="denial">Denial</h3>
<p>I check my pockets. Nothing. But they&rsquo;re really big pockets - maybe they&rsquo;re deeper down there? I look back out at the sea. Maybe. I duck my head underwater and feel around. Just maybe, I lost the camera right here, in this exact spot.</p>
<h3 id="anger">Anger</h3>
<p>Wow&hellip; I&rsquo;m an idiot. Why did I think this was a good idea? I slowly wade out to catch another wave.</p>
<h3 id="bargaining">Bargaining</h3>
<p>This must be punishment for me being an ass on the mountain that night. What if I just search for the rest of the day? It&rsquo;s not like the ocean is that big, or the water moves that much, or the camera is blue. Trying to stand on my board, I wipe out.</p>
<h3 id="depression">Depression</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lost so many pictures! Our entire group had photos on it and I&rsquo;ve let the team down. Deep in their hearts, they&rsquo;ll never forgive me  :'(</p>
<h3 id="acceptance">Acceptance</h3>
<p>Surfing was really fun.</p>

<p>Fast forward to the present: I&rsquo;m taking a matatu to meet some Kenyan friends. It&rsquo;s sunny in dry season Nairobi so I bring my sweet, sweet NASA hat. My old faithful has been with me ever since I fulfilled my dream of visiting the Kennedy Space Center during my second coop term. I wore the copper, denim, and leather with pride. The matatu is hot so I leave it on my lap.</p>

<p>By the time I&rsquo;m almost at my friend&rsquo;s place, I notice that I don&rsquo;t have it anymore.</p>
<h3 id="denial-1">Denial</h3>
<p>I dropped it on the ground walking from the matatu right?</p>
<h3 id="anger-1">Anger</h3>
<p>How did I not notice it dropping from my lap? Why did I not just put it in my bag? I stew as I walk back to where I got off, staring at the ground.</p>

<p>If I kept taking matatu for the rest of the day, could I find the right one? Maybe if I wait here diligently, the driver will come back to give me my hat. The lady running the nearby fried banana stand asks if I&rsquo;m ok. I cover up the pain and say I&rsquo;m fine, I&rsquo;m just checking if I&rsquo;m on the right street.</p>
<h3 id="depression-1">Depression</h3>
<p>That hat was amazing, I&rsquo;ll never get the same one again. It was a loyal friend and I betrayed it. I even made a hat-trade with Adam Savage.</p>

<p>Hey this giraffe hat is pretty sweet.</p>
<p>Over 4 years of university, I&rsquo;ve learned to leave a lot of things behind. I brought only a carry-on for my 4 month stay in Kenya. I idolize the idea that all I need in life are my wits and skills.</p>
<p>When I lose a practical possession, I barely care. Though sometimes I struggle to cope, I try to treat losing sentimental items the same way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll lose my memories with or without trinkets to anchor them. I&rsquo;m a forgetful person. Even as I write this post, I have to fabricate details. These hard earned stories will soon sink into the back of my mind, becoming an anonymous piece of me. And I will be distracted by a new story. Lose, forget, change &mdash; and repeat.</p>
