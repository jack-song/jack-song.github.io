<h3 id="subjectivity">Subjectivity</h3>

<p>An object that can be evaluated or interpreted differently by different subjects observing it.</p>

<p>An example is the series of portraits done by Guim Ti√≥, where black and white portraits receive strokes of colored paint. The meaning of the added color is abstract and open to interpretation.</p>

<h3 id="pictorial-space">Pictorial space</h3>

<p>The simulated sense of 3D space created by 2D artwork.</p>

<p>This is commonly seen in the world of matte paintings, where realistic artwork is used as backdrops in film, often imitating large spaces that are too expensive to build a set for. Mathieu Raynault has a studio for producing this kind of work.</p>

<h3 id="hyper-real">Hyper-real</h3>

<p>Realistic depictions are blended and stretched to into fictional depictions.</p>

<p>This can be used in the work of Rob Gonsalves, who uses optical illusions to combine realistic scenes in unrealistic ways.</p>

<h3 id="symbolism">Symbolism</h3>

<p>Work that leverages symbols to represent larger, or more complex ideas.</p>

<p>Chris Maynard carves images from feathers, a strong symbol for flight and freedom.</p>

<h3 id="alterity">Alterity</h3>

<p>Use of a pattern that alternates, or repeats.</p>

<p>Yaacov Agam uses alternity in shape and color to build optical effects and illusions.</p>

<h3 id="artifice">Artifice</h3>

<p>A high level of skill built by specialization, exprience, and craftsmanship.</p>

<p>Jeroen van Kesteren has built intricate cardboard models of airships, demonstrating an immensely skillful command over the use of cardboard as a sculptural material.</p>
