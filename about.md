I'm currently studying as a Software Engineer at the University of Waterloo, Canada. I really like making things. I'd love to discuss anything even remotely related to what I have up on my site:

###My work

For now, I mostly plan on sticking to my own projects to build up my basic skills and workflow. In the nearest possible future though, I definitely plan on joining an open source project that I'm interested in. 

Unfortunately, I can't just make everything that crosses my mind, so I try to decide based on a few considerations:  

- I want to play with something new (hopefully learn in the process)  
- I want to actually be interested in the final product I'm producing  
- I don't really want to rehash something I've already done  
  
While these seem like common sense, I've found that being very explicit helps me make more informed decisions on what to do with my time.
