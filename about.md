Hi! I'm currently studying as a Software Engineer at the University of Waterloo, Canada. I really like making things. I'd love to discuss anything I have up on my site, even remotely related, so to get the important stuff out of the way, I can be contacted at:

:envelope: jackthesong (at) gmail.com

###My other interests

Things I like, in no particular order:

- Digital Painting
- Judo
- Christopher Nolan
- Cave Story
- Homestuck
- Pretending to know how to play guitar
- Lord of the Rings
- Science!
- Portal
- Lists


###My work

[You can find more technical information on my projects page.][projects]

For now, I mostly plan on sticking to my own projects to build up my basic skills and workflow. In the nearest possible future though, I definitely plan on joining an open source project that I'm interested in. 

Unfortunately, I can't just make everything that crosses my mind, so I try to decide based on a few considerations:  

- I want to play with something new (hopefully learn in the process)  
- I want to actually be interested in the final product I'm producing  
- I don't really want to rehash something I've already done  
  
While these seem like common sense, I've found that being very explicit helps me make more informed decisions on what to do with my time.
