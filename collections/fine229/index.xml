      <description>Farah&amp;rsquo;s original work: https://minddrewablank.wordpress.com/2017/07/04/moving-still/
Herd is an image constructed from video sourced from Planet Earth. It compresses an overhead shot of a herd of animals into a single frame, creating a textured blur with sporadic details. Inspired by Corinne Vionnet&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Photo Opportunities,&amp;rsquo; Farah&amp;rsquo;s piece mimics a long exposure photo using photoshop. The piece is dominated by soft browns and grays, with shadowy lines and blotches as the only recognizable features. Visually, it is well balanced and ambiguous, lacking constrasts and distinct shapes.</description>

      <description>Deep remixability When previously separate mediums are being combined in various ways - not just by format, but by technique, culture, and other meta-characteristics as well.

Variable form A motion graphic sequence that never holds all its aspects static for long - some part of it is constantly in flux at some point in time.

Continuity turn The shift from discrete cuts and marked delimitations to continuous, gradual changes in motion graphic sequences.</description>

      <description>The Mental Game reflects a moment of tension that everyone has experienced before. As a child, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s jumping down more steps than you&amp;rsquo;ve ever tried. As a teenager, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s clicking &amp;ldquo;submit&amp;rdquo; on an application that will decide your future. As an adult, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s stepping into a class far out of your comfort zone. In a single moment, instinctual hesitation kicks in. Time seems to slow down and you feel separated from the world.</description>

      <description>Constructed Narrative When the contents of a photograph have been artificially created by the artist in some way to reflect a narrative, rather than simply photographing a real scene. An example is A Sudden Gust of Wind (after Hokusai), taken by Jeff Wall, portraying the same narrative as the woodcut that inspired the work. The photograph was constructed digitally from various pieces.

Tableau A photograph where the scene is assembled and actors are used to produce a certain result.</description>

      <description>Camera and Mic highlights the relationship between digital media and our physical senses. The piece prompts the viewer to recognize a pattern among 3 images.
The glitch highlights the eyes and ears to build an association with the title of the piece, suggesting that cameras and microphones imitate the eyes and ears. However, glitches are an explicit piece of evidence showing that these devices are not perfect. The presence of the glitches suggest a disconnect in how information is captured, though we frequently consume digital media as an illusionary extension of our own senses.</description>

      <description>A world with people:   
And a world without:   
Indexical A characteristic of images that implies a mapping to the original real world subject. Some relationship between the two is suggested, such as the chemical reactions driven by light reflected from a subject in film photography. This characteristic is debated in digital photography as physical interaction is less apparent, and converted into numerical data.</description>

      <description>A Pure Glitch is an effect either produced without intention or without understanding the underlying cause and system. A Glitch-alike is an effect produced purposefully and with some form of reasoning about how the effect was created.
My attempts are shown in a separate post here.

Datamoshing Datamoshing is an effect based on the visual presentation of compression artefacts found in lossy file formats. For this reason, they are often shown in certain common formats like GIFs, JPEGs, or video.</description>

      <description>Making Waves is a short story about a boat in the small fishing town of Lamu, Kenya.
Fishing has always been a mainstay in Lamu, but never the focus. It used to be a thriving port in the center of East African sea trade. Now it&amp;rsquo;s a UNESCO World Heritage site, relying on the tourism and investment of foreigners. However, the story isn&amp;rsquo;t over yet and nearby, one of the largest ports in East Africa is currently being built by Chinese corporations (Weitere).</description>

      <description>Stereography A technique to generate a sense of depth in a visualization by presenting a different image to each eye. Mimics the way humans naturally perceive depth in every day life. Various techniques have been used, ranging from mechanical devices working with film photographs to polarized light in a 3D movie. Can be a highly effective technique, but usually requires a fairly complex mechanism. This may affect the experience of the viewer.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to make a cinemagraph since I first saw one on Reddit. The stars aligned: when I visited Lamu, I actually remembered. Keeping this in mind, I took a bunch of pictures in continuous shooting.
Realizing that creating a nice cinemagraph would be a lot of work, I first threw my pictures onto Google photos. The automatic &amp;ldquo;animation&amp;rdquo; utility would give a good preview for how they might look. Here&amp;rsquo;s how they turned out (slow loading!</description>

      <description>Subjectivity An object that can be evaluated or interpreted differently by different subjects observing it.
An example is the series of portraits done by Guim Tió, where black and white portraits receive strokes of colored paint. The meaning of the added color is abstract and open to interpretation.

Pictorial space The simulated sense of 3D space created by 2D artwork.
This is commonly seen in the world of matte paintings, where realistic artwork is used as backdrops in film, often imitating large spaces that are too expensive to build a set for.</description>

      <description>It was one of my favorite subjects, and I even did extra classes. But these were technical sessions and offered very little creative flexibility; I quit often. To scratch the itch I turned to art on my own time: http://malsatas.deviantart.com/.
Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve understood that I like &amp;ldquo;doing art&amp;rdquo; because I enjoy creating and telling stories. I like building flavorful worlds and presenting compellling characters. I like the idea of reaching into people with stories.</description>
