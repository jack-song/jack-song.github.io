      <description>The San Francisco Bike Kitchen is where you find mechanical magic. This local non-profit, run by volunteers, offers a build-a-bike program for $40. This lets you build a bike with the used parts lying around the Kitchen. From frames to wheels to handlebars, patience is all that&amp;rsquo;s needed to assemble a custom ride.
I fully intended to bike everywhere when I moved to SF, and even picked an apartment location that would let me do that.</description>

      <title>The Most Foldable Ukulele in the World</title>

      <description>A few years ago, I started playing guitar at university and wanted to keep going when I moved around. My solution was to invest in a foldable Voyage Air guitar. It didn&amp;rsquo;t provide me with exactly the freedom and engineering satisfaction I was looking for: it was not truly foldable - it comes with a custom, oddly shaped backpack for carrying when packed away.
Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve always dreamed about just sawing a ukulele in half to take it to the extremes with no compromises.</description>

      <description>A gift that the previous owners of my home left. I didn&amp;rsquo;t think much of it until I watched the documentary California Typewriter on a flight! Brought it outside, cleaned it out, and now I have a nice, heavy, writing machine. I&amp;rsquo;m very lucky to have found it in working condition.
  This is the most similar model that I&amp;rsquo;ve found online, though the key labels seem slightly different. As a fan of mechanical keyboards already, using this typewriter is a joy.</description>

      <title>DIY camera finger strap to travel real light</title>

      <description>I just bought a used Fujifilm X70 in an attempt to save on space and weight. To keep chasing that goal, I made another change. Neck strap -&amp;gt; wrist strap -&amp;gt; finger strap. This is my take with the material I had lying around. I trimmed a simple velcro strap from some knock-off go-pro kit, and fitted it by trial and error:
        Comfortable, adjustable, and surprisingly secure.</description>
