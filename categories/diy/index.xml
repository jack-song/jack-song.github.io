      <description>A gift that the previous owners of my home left. I didn&amp;rsquo;t think much of it until I watched the documentary California Typewriter on a flight! Brought it outside, cleaned it out, and now I have a nice, heavy, writing machine. I&amp;rsquo;m very lucky to have found it in working condition.
  This is the most similar model that I&amp;rsquo;ve found online, though the key labels seem slightly different. As a fan of mechanical keyboards already, using this typewriter is a joy.</description>

      <description>I just bought a used Fujifilm X70 in an attempt to save on space and weight. To keep chasing that goal, I made another change. Neck strap -&amp;gt; wrist strap -&amp;gt; finger strap. This is my take with the material I had lying around. I trimmed a simple velcro strap from some knock-off go-pro kit, and fitted it by trial and error:
        Comfortable, adjustable, and surprisingly secure.</description>
