      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on a lot of projects (3d printing, grooming habits, video calling), but don&amp;rsquo;t publish enough. I don&amp;rsquo;t do the last 5%, I don&amp;rsquo;t risk it for the biscuit, and I don&amp;rsquo;t get enough feedback.</description>

      <description>part 2
Configuration, security, and deployment with SQS were all as easy as expected, and IAM has been a great convenience. It was also pretty straight forward to write tasks for Celery - but successes are not interesting.</description>

      <description>part 1
Our data pipeline needs a message broker for a Celery job queue; RabbitMQ and Amazon SQS are two good choices. They are designed to scale, guarantee message delivery, and seem to have good support.</description>

      <description>At my work, we&amp;rsquo;re building a pipeline to provide data-driven feedback to users.
The de-facto king for data is Python, thanks to its community. A common way to deploy these models is via a Flask application, but this isn&amp;rsquo;t a good fit for every case.</description>

Yes I did it for the free Alexa dev sweater.
No I haven&amp;rsquo;t retrieved my sweater yet. The ratings are pretty bad. People want the entire featured article read out to them.</description>

A chrome extension that predicts what website you&amp;rsquo;re going to &amp;mdash; so you don&amp;rsquo;t even have to type it in!
Our team&amp;rsquo;s base assumption is that we visit some websites in certain patterns, and a neural net might be able to pick up on them.</description>

      <description>On social media, we don&amp;rsquo;t communicate the way we do in real life. There are different protocols and habits, which can make interactions feel shallow or distracting.</description>

      <description>I thought I had found a flaw in the great google machine - instead I learned that &amp;ldquo;libraries are innocent until proven guilty&amp;rdquo;.
I am currently working on an app for Kenyan users, with validation for local phone numbers.</description>
